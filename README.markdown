# About

This is the theme that I built for [my website](http://cweagans.net).

I bought the design from ThemeForest, but it doesn't appear to be for sale anymore.

Warning: This theme is, for lack of a better term...crappy. It looks like the design, but that's about it. If you'd like some customizations done or you'd like to sponsor improvement of this theme, feel free to contact me.
